I developed a basic text editor using python and converted it into an application. As you can see there are two folders.
If you want to see the code then open the "Text Editor Code" folder. Otherwise, you can open the "Text Editor Application Folder" to download the application,
which is located in the "dist" folder. One thing to note here is that if you are downloading the code, make sure to download the Logo image
with it as well and you must make sure that it is in the same directory as the code. The same applies with the application unless you download the zip file. Other than that everything should hopefully work as expected. If you have any issues or questions feel free to ask.
